WATCHOUT FOR:

1. glfw openGL version:
"
By default, the OpenGL context GLFW creates may have any version. You can require a minimum OpenGL version by setting the GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR and GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR hints before creation. If the required minimum version is not supported on the machine, context (and window) creation fails.

You can select the OpenGL profile by setting the GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE hint. 
"
2. NOTICE- glew does the context initiation in glewInit()
3. Main loop - glut used its own main loop, in glfw it seems we have to create one.

4. Renderer default c'tor sets window as NULL
